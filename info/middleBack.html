                        <li>Start on your hands and knees in a tabletop position. Spread your knees wide apart but keep your big toes together. Sit up straight (avoid overarching or slumping forward) to lengthen your spine. From here, hinge at the hips and bow forward, placing your torso between your legs. Extend your arms out in front of you, palms flat against the ground.</li> 
                        <li>Stretch the muscles that rotate your back by sitting comfortably and turning your shoulders to one direction and holding in this position. Sitting on an exercise ball can help you perform this stretch comfortably.</li>
