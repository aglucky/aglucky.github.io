                        <li>Start on your hands and knees in a tabletop position. Spread your knees wide apart but keep your big toes together. Sit up straight (avoid overarching or slumping forward) to lengthen your spine. From here, hinge at the hips and bow forward, placing your torso between your legs. Extend your arms out in front of you, palms flat against the ground</li> 
                        <li>Sit forward at the edge of your chair (not so far that you lose balance). Place both hands on the back of your head, elbows pointing outward, and sit up straight. Your shoulders should be directly over your hips and your feet planted on the ground. Once you’re in starting position, slowly twist your torso to one side until your upper body is facing it completely. Your hips should still be facing forward. Hold for five to ten seconds. Untwist until you’re facing forward, and repeat on the other side.</li>
