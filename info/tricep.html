                        <li>Bring your arm up so that your tricep is facing away from you, then slowly push up until you feel a stretch and hold</li> 
                        <li>Stand with your injured arm over your head holding the end of a towel. Put your other arm behind your back and grab the towel. Lift the hand of your injured arm toward the ceiling while pulling down on the towel with your other hand. Keep the elbow of your injured arm as close to your ear as possible. Hold for 10 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
                        <li>Get onto your hands and knees, with your hands directly below your shoulders. Slowly bend your arms and lower yourself toward the floor, being careful to keep your spine straight. When you can do 2 sets of 15 easily, do this with your feet off the floor. Gradually progress to doing regular push-ups with your legs out straight.</li>
                    </ul>
